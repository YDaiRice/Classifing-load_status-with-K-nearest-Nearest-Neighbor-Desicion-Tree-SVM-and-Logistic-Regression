Data Visulization and Preprocessing
Feature Selection and Data Engineering
Find best model among the following classifiers
  K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
  Desicion Tree
  Support Vector Machine
  Logistic Regression
Calculate the Jaccard similarity and F1-score for classfier
Conclusion
Note: 1.Tried Random forest but becuase the dataset has only 300 data, Random forest has the similar accuracy with Decision Tree. 2. The F1-score is only for loan_status 'PAID_OFF' not for 'COLLECTION'.The F1-score for 'COLLECTION' is much lower than 'PAID_OFF'. I think it is becuase the dataset has much more 'PAID_OFF' label then 'COLLECTION' label(260:86), the predication bias toward 'PAID_OFF'. 3. I will try feature study with Random forest and parameter selection with cross-validation in future. The first one will improve understanding of dataset. The second one will enure better parameter selected.
